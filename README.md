# Nutella cork with support

As I was lost on YouTube shorts, I've seen someone creating snowball globes with empty Nutella jars. So I have planned to build a cork with a support aligned to do the same.

Warning, the cork is not waterproof, so if you will to fill the jar with water+glycerin and glitters, you need an o-ring or seal the cork with hot glue for example

Second warning, the pictures are not the final design, I firstly used blender to modify an existing model, but I prefer customizable things, so this is why I have created this scad file. The thread uses [this lib](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3252637), but as it is licensed as CC-BY-NC, and I wanted to let this as public domain, I can't distribute it with my code. If you want to customize, you will need both scad from the lib + this scad. All parameters are in millimeters.
